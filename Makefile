# rule of thumb: build one .o file per .c/.cpp file and one make all target that remakes everything
# this makes building faster since each time you change something, it make only rebuilds the object file for the file you changed
# it doesn't waste time rebuilding stuff you didn't edit
# compiling: checks syntax, expands #includes and #defines, outputs object file
# linking: links together libraries for the functions needed, outputs one combined binary file in memory to run
# target: dependencies
# the shell commands that are needed to build that target
# the target is imageview, and it depends on the object file
# we need C++, the object file, -o imageview tells the compiler to put the output of this build into imageview target
# the stuff underneath is the recepie we need to build this target
# we need the executable to include the object file, C++, and the libraries
# since this is the linking stage and happens after the compiling, we don't need the flags here
# adding the @ silences all the build info when i type make
# Cince I am using c++, g++. Use CXX everywhere that C was.
# CXX is the C++ compiler
CXX= g++

# -g will add compiler info, -Wall will show warnings, c++17 is the version of C++ we are using
# need to include the shell package config command because that tells the C++ compiler where to find the opencv library
# we are writing our own makefile and not using Cmake which is why we need to tell it where the library path is
# need to know where the library of files is during compiling to create the object file
CXXFLAGS= -g -Wall -std=c++17 -mfpu=neon $(shell pkg-config --cflags opencv4) -pthread

# libraries I want to link with this project

# to create the object file, it depends on the c++ file and the header file
# since this is what runs at compile time, we need to include the flags
# -c tells the compiler to just compile and stop after that, don't link yet
